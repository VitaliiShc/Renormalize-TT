# Renormalize

_The basic coding skill challenge_

## Task:

- You need to make a table and add a light/dark theme switch.
- Pagination/count per page/ search/row delete should be working items\*
- Search can be only by the name of the product, if you wish, you can also search the entire line\*

**You do NOT need the edit action for the row and the "Add a customer" button!**

Be sure to use **Next + TailwindCSS**, everything else is optional

Test task requires approximately 4-5 hours if you approach the problem correctly.

\* - This means it is optional but it will be great if it is done fully/partially
